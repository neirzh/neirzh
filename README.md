![Wassily Kandinsky's Composition VIII](wkcompviii.jpg)
### My North Star
I believe a human's capacity is much greater than what we think. And we must have the will to make use of that capacity and things we know to make this world a better place for everyone, We must live for a greater future disregarding our own comfort and success. It is this will that makes everything possible.
